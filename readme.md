# Style Guide experiment

Take a large existing style porject (gov.uk) and impliment in React with Styled Components and some kind of style guide.

Currently trying:

- Story book
- Stlyeguidist

## Use (Styleguidist):

- clone
- npm i
- npm run styleguide

Modify components and check the guide, no support for styled-component theme yet, always uses the default theme from Defaultprops.
